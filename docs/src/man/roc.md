# ROC

A good binary classifier should have high sensitivity
(able to recognize True Positive) and high specificity
(able to recognize True Negatives, hence have low False Positive).
A plot of the trade-off curve of True Positive Rate versus False Positive Rate
at various cutoff probabilities is called the
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.
One way to quantify performance is by the area under the ROC curve,
often abbreviated as AUC or C,
many packages compute AUC via numeric integration of the ROC curve.
AUC is in the range [0, 1], a perfect model has AUC of 1,
a random model has AUC of 0.5,
and a perfectly backwards model would have AUC of -1.

There is another interpretation of AUC which provides more intuition than
simply as the area under a curve.
If we make all possible pair-wise comparisons between the probabilities of
class 1 with class 0, we can count the incidences of:

- Concordant: class 1 probability > class 0 probability
- Tied: class 1 probability â‰ˆ class 0 probability
- Discordant: class 1 probability < class 0 probability

Then we can compute:

- AUC: (Concordant + 0.5 Tied) / (N1 * N0)
- Gini: 2AUC - 1, or (Concordant - Discordant) / (N1 * N0)
- Goodman-Kruskal Gamma: (Concordant - Discordant) / (Concordant + Discordant), no penalty for Tied
- Kendall's Tau: (Concordant - Discordant) / (0.5 * (N1+N0) * (N1+N0-1))

We can interpret AUC as the percentage of time class 1 probabilities is larger
than class 0 probabilities (ignoring ties).

## Example

Create data:

```@example roc
using ROCKS
using Random
using Distributions

Random.seed!(888)
const x = rand(Uniform(-5, 5), 1_000_000)
const logit = -3.0 .+ 0.5 .* x .+ rand(Normal(0, 0.1), length(x))
const prob = @. 1.0 / (1.0 + exp(-logit))
const target = rand(length(x)) .<= prob
nothing # hide
```
 
Now compute roc:

```@example roc
roc(target, prob)
```

`roc` returns results in a named tuple:

- `conc`, number of concordant comparisons
- `tied`, number of tied comparisons
- `disc`, number of discordant comparisons
- `auc`, area under ROC curve, or just area under curve
- `gini`, 2auc - 1

## Concordance

In this package, `roc` is just a synonym for the `concordance` function.
We can use it in a more general setting of comparing two distributions.

```@example roc
using Random
using Distributions
using StatsBase

Random.seed!(123)
w1 = rand(Weibull(1.3, 30_000), 100_000)
w2 = rand(Weibull(1.3, 33_000), 100_000)

mean(w1), mean(w2)
```

## Fixed width tied region

Values +/- 1,000 are considered ties:

```@example roc
cls = [fill(0, length(w1)); fill(1, length(w2))]
values = [w1; w2]
c = concordance(cls, values, 1_000)
```

We can compute percentages as follows:

```@example roc
tot = c.conc + c.tied + c.disc
println("Concordant %: ", round(c.conc/tot, digits=4),
        "\nTied       %: ", round(c.tied/tot, digits=4),
        "\nDiscordant %: ", round(c.disc/tot, digits=4))
```

We can interpret it as, if cls[2] on aggregate has higher value than cls[1],
the statement is true concordant% of the time,
the statement is neither true or false tied% of the time,
the statement is false discordant% of the time.
Whereas the simplistic global statement suggests it is true all the time,
we now know the extent it is true and can argue that it is in fact
false discordant% of the time and assess decisions made based
on better insights.

## Percentage width tied range

Rather than a fixed tied region, it may be appropriate to have variable
tied region, e.g., when comparing income, it would be better to use
a percentage rather than fixed amount.

Here's an example where values within 10% are considered as tied:

```@example roc
pct(x) = 0.9*x, 1.1*x
c = concordance(cls, values, pct)
tot = c.conc + c.tied + c.disc
println("Concordant %: ", round(c.conc/tot, digits=4),
        "\nTied       %: ", round(c.tied/tot, digits=4),
        "\nDiscordant %: ", round(c.disc/tot, digits=4))
```
